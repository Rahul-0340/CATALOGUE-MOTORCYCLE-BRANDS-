# 🏍️ Motorcycle Brands Catalogue Analysis

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes a dataset of motorcycle listings to understand **pricing trends**, **brand frequency**, and **sales performance**. The analysis includes comparing **selling prices** with **ex-showroom prices**, examining **kilometers driven**, and reviewing trends by **brand**, **year**, and **ownership type** to provide insights into the used motorcycle market.

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Excel** (initial data processing and pivot tables)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **OpenPyXL** (Excel data handling)
